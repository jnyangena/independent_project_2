## Birthday and Day Name

### Author: Job Nyangena

### Description
This web application takes your date of birth as input and outputs the day of the week that you were born and then depending on your gender, outputs your Akan name.

The Akan People of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These day names have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.
